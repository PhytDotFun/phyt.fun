Welcome! We are glad that you want to contribute to Phyt

**Please note:** We are not currently accepting code contributions or pull requests on the main app repository. However, we greatly value community feedback and involvement in other ways.

We are planning multiple open source projects and tools that we will happily accept contributions for so please stay tuned.

As you get started, you are in the best position to give us feedback on areas where we can improve:

- Problems found during setup or usage
- Gaps in our documentation
- Bugs or unexpected behavior
- Ideas for new features or improvements
- Security vulnerabilities

If anything doesn't make sense, doesn't work as expected, or could be improved, please let us know by opening an issue!

## Ways to Contribute

We welcome several types of non-code contributions:

- **Bug reports** - Help us identify and fix issues
- **Feature suggestions** - Share ideas for improvements or new functionality
- **Documentation feedback** - Point out unclear or missing information
- **Security reports** - Responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities
- **Issue triage** - Help organize and clarify existing issues
- **Community support** - Answer questions and help other users
- **Feedback and suggestions** - Share your experience and ideas

While we don't accept code contributions directly, your input helps guide our development priorities and improves the project for everyone.

## Reporting Issues

We encourage you to report any bugs, problems, or unexpected behavior you encounter. When reporting issues, please:

1. **Search existing issues first** to see if the problem has already been reported
2. **Use a clear, descriptive title** that summarizes the issue
3. **Provide detailed information** including:
    - Steps to reproduce the problem
    - Expected behavior vs. actual behavior
    - Your environment (OS, version, etc.)
    - Any error messages or screenshots
    - Relevant configuration details

The more information you provide, the easier it will be for us to understand and address the issue.

**Labels to look for:**

- `bug` - Confirmed issues that need fixing
- `documentation` - Problems with docs or missing information
- `question` - General questions about usage

## Security Issues

Security is important to us. If you discover a security vulnerability, please do **NOT** report it through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report security issues responsibly following our [Security Policy](SECURITY.md). We offer multiple reporting options:

- **GitHub Security Advisories** (recommended) - Use the "Security" tab to report privately
- **Direct contact** - Email, Discord, or X/Twitter as detailed in our security policy

We take all security reports seriously and follow responsible disclosure practices. See our full Security Policy for details on our response process, timelines, and recognition system.

## Making Suggestions

We value your ideas for improving the project! When making suggestions:

1. **Check existing issues** to see if the idea has been discussed
2. **Open a new issue** with the `enhancement` or `feature-request` label
3. **Describe your suggestion clearly** including:
    - The problem or limitation you're trying to solve
    - Your proposed solution or feature
    - Why this would be valuable to other users
    - Any alternatives you've considered

Even if we can't implement every suggestion, community input helps us understand user needs and prioritize our roadmap.

## Ask for Help

The best way to reach us with questions is:

**Twitter for anything and everything (recommended)**

- **GitHub Issues** - For bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions** - For general questions and community discussion
- **Documentation** - Check our docs for common questions
- **Email** - For security issues or private inquiries

When asking for help, please provide context about what you're trying to accomplish and what specific problems you're encountering.
